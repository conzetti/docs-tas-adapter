# Installing Application Service Adapter

This topic describes how to install the Application Service Adapter for VMware Tanzu Application Platform system:

* [Install the package repository](#install-package-repo)
* [Configure the installation settings](#configure-installation-settings)
* [Install Application Service Adapter](#install-adapter)
* [Configure DNS for the Application Service Adapter](#configure-dns)
* [Assign the admin role to a user](#assign-admin-user)

----

After you have completed the steps in [Installing Prerequisites](install-prerequisites.md), set the Kubernetes context to the cluster where you have installed kpack and Contour.


## <a id="install-package-repo"></a>Install the package repository

To install Application Service Adapter:

1. Set up environment variables for the installation:

    ```bash
    export TAS_ADAPTER_VERSION=VERSION-NUMBER
    ```

    Where `VERSION-NUMBER` is the version of Application Service Adapter you want to install. For example, `1.0.0`.

1. Verify that the `tap-install` namespace exists in your cluster.

    ```bash
    kubectl get ns tap-install
    ```

    The output should list the status of the `tap-install` namespace:
    ```bash
    NAME          STATUS   AGE
    tap-install   Active   2d
    ```

1. Create a registry secret to store your Tanzu Network credentials in the `tap-install` namespace. These are required so that the Kubernetes cluster can pull images for the Application Service Adapter system from the Tanzu Network registry.

    ```bash
    tanzu secret registry add tanzunet-tas-adapter-registry \
      --username "TANZU-NET-USERNAME" \
      --password "TANZU-NET-PASSWORD" \
      --server registry.tanzu.vmware.com \
      --export-to-all-namespaces \
      --yes \
      --namespace tap-install
    ```

   Where:

   - `TANZU-NET-USERNAME` is your username on Tanzu Network.
   - `TANZU-NET-PASSWORD` the password for your username on Tanzu Network.

1. Add the Application Service Adapter package repository to the cluster.

    ```bash
    tanzu package repository add tas-adapter-repository \
      --url registry.tanzu.vmware.com/app-service-adapter/tas-adapter-package-repo:${TAS_ADAPTER_VERSION} \
      --namespace tap-install
    ```
1. Verify that the package repository contains the Application Service Adapter package.

    ```bash
    tanzu package available list \
      --namespace tap-install
    ```

   The output includes the Application Service Adapter package:

    ```bash
    NAME                                          DISPLAY-NAME                 SHORT-DESCRIPTION                                                   LATEST-VERSION
    ...
    application-service-adapter.tanzu.vmware.com  Application Service Adapter  Application Service Adapter for VMware TanzuÂ® Application Platform  1.0.0
    ...
    ```

1. List the installation settings for the `application-service-adapter` package.

    ```bash
    tanzu package available get application-service-adapter.tanzu.vmware.com/${TAS_ADAPTER_VERSION} --values-schema --namespace tap-install
    ```

   It should output a list of settings similar to:

    ```

      ...
    ```

## <a id="configure-installation-settings"></a>Configure the installation settings

To configure the installation settings:

1. If you do not already have a secret containing a certificate and private key pair for HTTPS ingress to the Application Service Adapter API:
   * If you have a certificate and private key pair, create a secret containing them:

      ```bash
      kubectl create namespace API-TLS-SECRET-NAMESPACE
      kubectl create secret tls API-TLS-SECRET-NAME \
        --cert=tls.crt \
        --key=tls.key \
        --namespace API-TLS-SECRET-NAMESPACE
     ```

   * If you do not have a certificate and private key pair, you can [use cert-manager to generate a secret containing a self-signed certificate](https://cert-manager.io/docs/usage/certificate/#creating-certificate-resources):

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
    ---
    apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
    kind: Issuer
    metadata:
      name: selfsigned-issuer
      namespace: API-TLS-SECRET-NAMESPACE
    spec:
      selfSigned: {}
    ---
    apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
    kind: Certificate
    metadata:
      name: api-selfsigned-certificate
      namespace: API-TLS-SECRET-NAMESPACE
    spec:
      commonName: API-FQDN
      dnsNames:
        - API-FQDN
      issuerRef:
        name: selfsigned-issuer
      privateKey:
        algorithm: RSA
      secretName: API-TLS-SECRET-NAME
      usages:
      - server auth
      - client auth
    EOF
    ```

1. If you do not already have a secret containing a wildcard certificate and private key pair for HTTPS application ingress:
   * If you have a wildcard certificate and private key pair, create a secret containing them:

      ```bash
      kubectl create namespace APP-TLS-SECRET-NAMESPACE
      kubectl create secret tls APP-TLS-SECRET-NAME \
        --cert=tls.crt \
        --key=tls.key \
        --namespace APP-TLS-SECRET-NAMESPACE
     ```

   * If you do not have a wildcard certificate and private key pair, you can [use cert-manager to generate a Secret containing a self-signed wildcard certificate](https://cert-manager.io/docs/usage/certificate/#creating-certificate-resources):

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
    ---
    apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
    kind: Issuer
    metadata:
      name: selfsigned-issuer
      namespace: APP-TLS-SECRET-NAMESPACE
    spec:
      selfSigned: {}
    ---
    apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
    kind: Certificate
    metadata:
      name: app-domain-selfsigned-certificate
      namespace: APP-TLS-SECRET-NAMESPACE
    spec:
      commonName: *.DEFAULT-APP-DOMAIN
      dnsNames:
        - *.DEFAULT-APP-DOMAIN
      issuerRef:
        name: selfsigned-issuer
      privateKey:
        algorithm: RSA
      secretName: APP-TLS-SECRET-NAME
      usages:
      - server auth
      - client auth
    EOF
    ```

1. If you do not already have a secret containing the hostname, username, and password for your application image registry:
   * Create a secret.

      ```bash
      kubectl create namespace APP-REGISTRY-CREDENTIALS-SECRET-NAMESPACE
      kubectl create secret docker-registry APP-REGISTRY-CREDENTIALS-SECRET-NAME \
        --docker-server=APP-REGISTRY-HOSTNAME \
        --docker-username=APP-REGISTRY-USERNAME \
        --docker-password=$(cat /path/to/APP-REGISTRY-PASSWORD) \
        --namespace APP-REGISTRY-CREDENTIALS-SECRET-NAMESPACE
      ```

1. Create a `SecretExport` to allow Application Service Adapter to copy the application image registry credentials secret into the `cf` namespace.

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
   ---
   apiVersion: secretgen.carvel.dev/v1alpha1
   kind: SecretExport
   metadata:
     name: APP-REGISTRY-CREDENTIALS-SECRET-NAME
     namespace: APP-REGISTRY-CREDENTIALS-SECRET-NAMESPACE
   spec:
     toNamespace: cf
   EOF
   ```

1. Create a `tas-adapter-values.yml` file with the desired installation settings, following the schema specified for the package.

   The following values are required:

    ```yaml
    ---
    ceip_policy_disclosed: FALSE-OR-TRUE-VALUE # Installation fails if this is not set to the boolean value true. Not a string.
    api_ingress:
      fqdn: "API-FQDN"
      tls:
        secret_name: API-TLS-SECRET-NAME
        namespace: API-TLS-SECRET-NAMESPACE
    app_ingress:
      default_domain: "DEFAULT-APP-DOMAIN"
      tls:
        secret_name: APP-TLS-SECRET-NAME
        namespace: APP-TLS-SECRET-NAMESPACE
    app_registry:
      credentials:
        secret_name: "APP-REGISTRY-CREDENTIALS-SECRET-NAME"
        namespace: "APP-REGISTRY-CREDENTIALS-SECRET-NAMESPACE"
      hostname: "APP-REGISTRY-HOSTNAME"
      path:
        droplets: "APP-REGISTRY-PATH-DROPLETS"
        packages: "APP-REGISTRY-PATH-PACKAGES"
    ```

   Where:

   - `API-FQDN` is the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) that you want to use for the Application Service Adapter API. Example: `api.example.com`
   - `API-TLS-SECRET-NAME` is the `kubernetes.io/tls` secret containing the PEM-encoded public certificate for the Application Service Adapter API.
   - `API-TLS-SECRET-NAMESPACE` is the namespace containing the API TLS secret.
   - `DEFAULT-APP-DOMAIN` is the domain that you want to use for automatically configured application routes. Example: `apps.example.com`.
   - `APP-TLS-SECRET-NAME` is the `kubernetes.io/tls` secret containing the PEM-encoded public certificate for applications deployed using the Application Service Adapter.
   - `APP-TLS-SECRET-NAMESPACE` is the namespace containing the application TLS secret.
   - `APP-REGISTRY-CREDENTIALS-SECRET-NAME` is the `kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson` secret containing the hostname, username and password for the application image registry.
   - `APP-REGISTRY-CREDENTIALS-SECRET-NAMESPACE` is the namespace containing the application image registry secret.
   - `APP-REGISTRY-HOSTNAME` is the hostname of the registry to be used for app packages and droplets. This value should be the same as the server name in a `dockerconfigjson` Kubernetes secret. Examples:
     - Harbor has the form `hostname: "my-harbor.io"`
     - Docker Hub has the form `hostname: "https://index.docker.io/v1"`
     - Google Container Registry has the form `hostname: "gcr.io"`
   - `APP-REGISTRY-PATH-DROPLETS` is the path to the directory or project in the app registry where Application Service Adapter uploads droplets, such as runnable application images. This value should not include the registry hostname itself. Examples:
     - Harbor has the form `droplets: "project-name/my-repo-name"`
     - Docker Hub has the form `droplets: "my-dockerhub-username"`
     - Google Container Registry has the form `droplets: "project-id/my-repo-name"`
   - `APP-REGISTRY-PATH-PACKAGES` is the is the path to the directory or project in the app registry where Application Service Adapter uploads packages, such as application source code. This value should not include the registry hostname itself. Examples:
     - Harbor has the form `packages: "project-name/my-repo-name"`
     - Docker Hub has the form `packages: "my-dockerhub-username"`
     - Google Container Registry has the form `packages: "project-id/my-repo-name"`

   The following values are optional but recommended:

    ```yaml
    ---
    admin:
      users:
      - "ADMIN-USERNAME"
      ...
    ```

   Where:

   - `ADMIN-USERNAME` is the name of an existing user to grant system admin privileges. You can specify as many users as you want, one per line. These names should be identifiers for user accounts, not Kubernetes service accounts.

   See additional optional values in the following example. For more information, see the Tanzu CLI output.

    ```yaml

    telemetry:
      heartbeat_interval: TELEMETRY-HEARTBEAT-INTERVAL
    user_certificate_expiration_warning_duration: "USER-CERT-EXPIRY-WARNING-DURATION"
    ```

   Where:

   - `API-AUTH-PROXY-TLS-CRT` is the CA certificate from the authentication proxy running along side your Kubernetes cluster.
   - `API-AUTH-PROXY-FQDN` is the FQDN for the authentication proxy running along side your Kubernetes cluster.
   - `PEM-ENCODED-CERTIFICATE-CONTENTS` is a PEM encoded multiline string containing the Certificate Authority certificate
       - The value must be inserted into your values file as a yaml multiline string with a block scalar literal.
   - `KPACK-CLUSTER-BUILDER-NAME` is the name of the kpack cluster builder to use for staging. Tanzu Build Service provides two cluster builders named `base` and `default`. To create your own builder, see [Managing Builders](https://docs.vmware.com/en/Tanzu-Build-Service/1.3/vmware-tanzu-build-service-v13/GUID-managing-builders.html) in the Tanzu Build Service documentation, and update this setting with the corresponding builder name.

   - `API-CPU-LIMIT` is the desired CPU resource limit for the pods in the specified deployment. Default is 1 cpu.
   - `API-MEMORY-LIMIT` is the desired memory resource limit for the pods in the specified deployment. Default is 1000Mi.
   - `API-CPU-REQUEST` is the desired CPU resource request for the pods in the specified deployment. Default is 50m.
   - `API-MEMORY-REQUEST` is the desired memory resource request for the pods in the specified deployment. Default is 100Mi.
   - `API-REPLICA-COUNT` is the desired number of replicas for the specified deployment. Default is 1.
   - `KUBERNETES-DISTRIBUTION` is the name of the kubernetes distribution. Defaults to "".
       - Set "openshift" as the value when installing on an OpenShift environment.
       - Leave it unset for all other distributions. 
   - `TELEMETRY-HEARTBEAT-INTERVAL` is how often telemetry data is sent to VMware. Default is every 24 hours.

   The `requests` and `limits` fields map directly to the resource requests and limits fields on the Kubernetes containers for these system components.
   For more information, see [Resource requests and limits of Pod and container](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#resource-requests-and-limits-of-pod-and-container) in the Kubernetes documentation.


### <a id="opt-out-telemetry"></a>Opting out of telemetry reporting

By default, when you install Application Service Adapter, you opt into telemetry collection. To turn off telemetry collection, complete the following instructions:

1. Ensure your Kubernetes context is pointing to the cluster where Application Service Adapter is installed.

1. Run the following kubectl command:

  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Namespace
  metadata:
    name: vmware-system-telemetry
  ---
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: ConfigMap
  metadata:
    namespace: vmware-system-telemetry
    name: vmware-telemetry-cluster-ceip
  data:
    level: disabled
  EOF
  ```

Your Application Service Adapter deployment no longer emits telemetry, and you are opted out of the VMware Customer Experience Improvement Program.

### <a id="custom-ca-registry"></a>Configure a Registry With a Custom Certificate Authority

To configure Application Service Adapter with a registry that has a custom or self-signed certificate authority:

1. Set the value of the `app_registry_credentials.ca_cert_data` property in the `tas-adapter-values.yml` file with a PEM encoded Certificate Authority certificate.

> **Note:** Your cluster nodes must trust the Certificate Authority that the Application Service Adapter is configured with. Tanzu Build Service must be configured to trust this registry Certificate Authority certificate.

## <a id="experimental-cartographer-integration"></a>(Optional) Configure the Experimental Cartographer Integration

> **Note**: Opting into the experimental Cartographer integration requires a larger set of Tanzu Application Platform packages to be installed. See [Required components for experimental Cartographer integration](install-prerequisites.md#required-components-cartographer) in _Install Prerequisites_.

To configure the experimental Cartographer integration:

1. Set the value of the `experimental_use_cartographer` property in the `tas-adapter-values.yml` file to `true`. Note that this value is a boolean and not a string.

## <a id="install-adapter"></a>Install Application Service Adapter

To install Application Service Adapter:

1. Install Application Service Adapter to the cluster.

    ```bash
    tanzu package install tas-adapter \
      --package-name application-service-adapter.tanzu.vmware.com \
      --version "${TAS_ADAPTER_VERSION}" \
      --values-file tas-adapter-values.yml \
      --namespace tap-install
    ```

1. Verify that the package install was successful.

    ```bash
    tanzu package installed get tas-adapter \
      --namespace tap-install
    ```

   The output looks like the following:

    ```bash
    | Retrieving installation details for tas-adapter...
    NAME:                    tas-adapter
    PACKAGE-NAME:            application-service-adapter.tanzu.vmware.com
    PACKAGE-VERSION:         1.0.0
    STATUS:                  Reconcile succeeded
    CONDITIONS:              [{ReconcileSucceeded True  }]
    USEFUL-ERROR-MESSAGE:
    ```

## <a id="configure-dns"></a>Configure DNS for Application Service Adapter

To configure DNS for Application Service Adapter:

1. Determine the external IP address to be used for ingress to your cluster. This step varies depending on the IaaS used to provision your cluster.

   For clusters that support LoadBalancer services, you can obtain the external IP address of the LoadBalancer Service that is associated with Contour's Envoy proxy. The Namespace for this service is typically either `tanzu-system-ingress` or `projectcontour` depending on how Contour was installed.

    ```bash
    kubectl -n tanzu-system-ingress get service envoy -ojsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[*].ip}'
    ```

   > **Note:** If you are using a cluster deployed on AWS, your LoadBalancer has a DNS name instead of an IP address.

1. Create an A record in your DNS zone that resolves the configured API FQDN to the external IP address from step 1. This step varies depending on your DNS provider.

   > **Note:** If you are using a cluster deployed on AWS, create a CNAME record that resolves to the DNS name of the load balancer instead of an A record.

1. Create a wildcard A record in your DNS zone that resolves all sub-domains of the configured application domain to the external IP address from step 1. This step varies depending on your DNS provider.

1. Verify that the Contour HTTPProxy for the API endpoint is valid.

    ```bash
    kubectl -n korifi-api-system get httpproxy korifi-api-proxy
    ```

   The output looks like the following:
    ```bash
    NAME               FQDN       TLS SECRET                STATUS   STATUS DESCRIPTION
    korifi-api-proxy   API-FQDN   korifi-api-ingress-cert   valid    Valid HTTPProxy
    ```

## <a id="assign-admin-user"></a>Log in with a system admin user

After you install the Cloud Foundry command-line interface (cf CLI), log in to Application Service Adapter with one of the system admin users you configured in the `admin.users` value:

1. Target the cf CLI at the API endpoint.

    ```bash
    cf api API-FQDN --skip-ssl-validation
    ```

    Where `API-FQDN` is the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for the Application Service Adapter API.

    >**Note:** If you configured the Application Service Adapter with a globally trusted certificate during installation, you can omit the `--skip-ssl-validation` flag.

1. Log in with the cf CLI.

    ```bash
    cf login
    ```

    The cf CLI detects the user authentication entries in your local Kubeconfig file and presents them for you to select one interactively. Select an entry corresponding to one of the users you configured in the list in the `admin.users` value.

1. Use the `cf curl` command to verify the subject name of the logged-in user.

    ```bash
    cf curl /whoami
    ```

    The output looks like the following:

    ```
    {"name":"my_user@example.com","kind":"User"}
    ```

    The value of the `name` field in the response is the subject name of the user, and should match the name configured in `admin.users`.

    >**Note:** The `kind` field in the output must have the value `User`. If it is some other value, such as `ServiceAccount`, log in to the Application Service Adapter with an account for a user in the Kubernetes cluster.


   To test Application Service Adapter, continue to [Getting Started](getting-started.md).
